    <h1>Hardy's Wessex</h1>

  <div class="quote">

       <p>It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround itâ€”except perhaps during the droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways.</p>

       <p>This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.</p>

       <p><a href= "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> is one of the greatest writers in English in my opinion. Alongside Tennyson and Christina Rosetti, his work shines out as one of the brightest stars. His poetic writing has brought joy to lots of people, and helps them to find a moment of calm amidst the <i>strain</i> of living. Much of his skill in books like Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Far From the Madding Crowd and The Woodlanders, must have been developed quite a bit in the times when he composed his <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48729/the-shadow-on-the-stone">poetry</a>. Please see below some suggestions for reading if you are new to this author or if you want to get a taste of old England through reading:</p>
